Again he measured off a thousand and had me wade; the water was up to my waist.\nOnce more he measured off a thousand, but there was now a river through which I could not wade; for the water had risen so high it had become a river that could not be crossed except by swimming.\nHe asked me, \"Have you seen this, son of man?\" Then he brought me to the bank of the river, where he had me sit.\nAlong the bank of the river I saw very many trees on both sides.\nHe said to me, \"This water flows into the eastern district down upon the Arabah, and empties into the sea, the salt waters, which it makes fresh.\nWherever the river flows, every sort of living creature that can multiply shall live, and there shall be abundant fish, for wherever this water comes the sea shall be made fresh.\nAlong both banks of the river, fruit trees of every kind shall grow; their leaves shall not fade, nor their fruit fail.

Before all the people they ordered:\n\"Send for Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah, the wife of Joakim.\" When she was sent for,\nshe came with her parents, children and all her relatives.\nAll her relatives and the onlookers were weeping.\nIn the midst of the people the two elders rose up and laid their hands on her head.\nThrough her tears she looked up to heaven, for she trusted in the Lord wholeheartedly.\nThe elders made this accusation: \"As we were walking in the garden alone, this woman entered with two girls and shut the doors of the garden, dismissing the girls.\nA young man, who was hidden there, came and lay with her.\nWhen we, in a corner of the garden, saw this crime, we ran toward them.\nWe saw them lying together, but the man we could not hold, because he was stronger than we; he opened the doors and ran off.\nThen we seized this one and asked who the young man was,\nbut she refused to tell us. We testify to this.\" The assembly believed them, since they were elders and judges of the people, and they condemned her to death.\nBut Susanna cried aloud: \"O eternal God, you know what is hidden and are aware of all things before they come to be:\nyou know that they have testified falsely against me. Here I am about to die, though I have done none of the things with which these wicked men have charged me.\"\nThe Lord heard her prayer.\nAs she was being led to execution, God stirred up the holy spirit of a young boy named Daniel,\nand he cried aloud: \"I will have no part in the death of this woman.\"\nAll the people turned and asked him, \"What is this you are saying?\"\nHe stood in their midst and continued, \"Are you such fools, O Israelites! To condemn a woman of Israel without examination and without clear evidence?\nReturn to court, for they have testified falsely against her.\"\nThen all the people returned in haste. To Daniel the elders said, \"Come, sit with us and inform us, since God has given you the prestige of old age.\"\nBut he replied, \"Separate these two far from one another that I may examine them.\"\nAfter they were separated one from the other, he called one of them and said: \"How you have grown evil with age! Now have your past sins come to term:\npassing unjust sentences, condemning the innocent, and freeing the guilty, although the Lord says, \"The innocent and the just you shall not put to death.'\nNow, then, if you were a witness, tell me under what tree you saw them together.\"\n\"Under a mastic tree,\" he answered. \"Your fine lie has cost you your head,\" said Daniel; \"for the angel of God shall receive the sentence from him and split you in two.\"\nPutting him to one side, he ordered the other one to be brought. \"Offspring of Canaan, not of Judah,\" Daniel said to him, \"beauty has seduced you, lust has subverted your conscience.\nThis is how you acted with the daughters of Israel, and in their fear they yielded to you; but a daughter of Judah did not tolerate your wickedness.\nNow, then, tell me under what tree you surprised them together.\"\n\"Under an oak,\" he said. \"Your fine lie has cost you also your head,\" said Daniel; \"for the angel of God waits with a sword to cut you in two so as to make an end of you both.\"\nThe whole assembly cried aloud, blessing God who saves those that hope in him.\nThey rose up against the two elders, for by their own words Daniel had convicted them of perjury. According to the law of Moses, they inflicted on them the penalty they had plotted to impose on their neighbor:\nthey put them to death. Thus was innocent blood spared that day."

Rather, let the greatest among you be as the youngest, and the leader as the servant.\nFor who is greater: the one seated at table or the one who serves? Is it not the one seated at table? I am among you as the one who serves.\nIt is you who have stood by me in my trials;\nand I confer a kingdom on you, just as my Father has conferred one on me,\nthat you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\nSimon, Simon, behold Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat,\nbut I have prayed that your own faith may not fail; and once you have turned back, you must strengthen your brothers.\"\nHe said to him, \"Lord, I am prepared to go to prison and to die with you.\"\nBut he replied, \"I tell you, Peter, before the cock crows this day, you will deny three times that you know me.\"\nHe said to them, \"When I sent you forth without a money bag or a sack or sandals, were you in need of anything?\" \"No, nothing,\" they replied.\nHe said to them, \"But now one who has a money bag should take it, and likewise a sack, and one who does not have a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.\nFor I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, namely, 'He was counted among the wicked'; and indeed what is written about me is coming to fulfillment.\"\nThen they said, \"Lord, look, there are two swords here.\" But he replied, \"It is enough!\"\nThen going out he went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.\nWhen he arrived at the place he said to them, \"Pray that you may not undergo the test.\"\nAfter withdrawing about a stone's throw from them and kneeling, he prayed,\nsaying, \"Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me; still, not my will but yours be done.\"\n(And to strengthen him an angel from heaven appeared to him.\nHe was in such agony and he prayed so fervently that his sweat became like drops of blood falling on the ground.)\nWhen he rose from prayer and returned to his disciples, he found them sleeping from grief.\nHe said to them, \"Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not undergo the test.\"\nWhile he was still speaking, a crowd approached and in front was one of the Twelve, a man named Judas. He went up to Jesus to kiss him.\nJesus said to him, \"Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?\"\nHis disciples realized what was about to happen, and they asked, \"Lord, shall we strike with a sword?\"\nAnd one of them struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear.\nBut Jesus said in reply, \"Stop, no more of this!\" Then he touched the servant's ear and healed him.\nAnd Jesus said to the chief priests and temple guards and elders who had come for him, \"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?\nDay after day I was with you in the temple area, and you did not seize me; but this is your hour, the time for the power of darkness.\"\nAfter arresting him they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest; Peter was following at a distance.\nThey lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it, and Peter sat down with them.\nWhen a maid saw him seated in the light, she looked intently at him and said, \"This man too was with him.\"\nBut he denied it saying, \"Woman, I do not know him.\"\nA short while later someone else saw him and said, \"You too are one of them\"; but Peter answered, \"My friend, I am not.\"\nAbout an hour later, still another insisted, \"Assuredly, this man too was with him, for he also is a Galilean.\"\nBut Peter said, \"My friend, I do not know what you are talking about.\" Just as he was saying this, the cock crowed,\nand the Lord turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, \"Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.\"\nHe went out and began to weep bitterly.\nThe men who held Jesus in custody were ridiculing and beating him.\nThey blindfolded him and questioned him, saying, \"Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?\"\nAnd they reviled him in saying many other things against him.\nWhen day came the council of elders of the people met, both chief priests and scribes, and they brought him before their Sanhedrin.\nThey said, \"If you are the Messiah, tell us,\" but he replied to them, \"If I tell you, you will not believe,\nand if I question, you will not respond.\nBut from this time on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\"\nThey all asked, \"Are you then the Son of God?\" He replied to them, \"You say that I am.\"\nThen they said, \"What further need have we for testimony? We have heard it from his own mouth.\"\nThen the whole assembly of them arose and brought him before Pilate.\nThey brought charges against him, saying, \"We found this man misleading our people; he opposes the payment of taxes to Caesar and maintains that he is the Messiah, a king.\"\nPilate asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" He said to him in reply, \"You say so.\"\nPilate then addressed the chief priests and the crowds, \"I find this man not guilty.\"\nBut they were adamant and said, \"He is inciting the people with his teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee where he began even to here.\"\nOn hearing this Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean;\nand upon learning that he was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod who was in Jerusalem at that time.\nHerod was very glad to see Jesus; he had been wanting to see him for a long time, for he had heard about him and had been hoping to see him perform some sign.\nHe questioned him at length, but he gave him no answer.\nThe chief priests and scribes, meanwhile, stood by accusing him harshly.\n(Even) Herod and his soldiers treated him contemptuously and mocked him, and after clothing him in resplendent garb, he sent him back to Pilate.\nHerod and Pilate became friends that very day, even though they had been enemies formerly.\nPilate then summoned the chief priests, the rulers, and the people\nand said to them, \"You brought this man to me and accused him of inciting the people to revolt. I have conducted my investigation in your presence and have not found this man guilty of the charges you have brought against him,\nnor did Herod, for he sent him back to us. So no capital crime has been committed by him.\nTherefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.\"\n\nBut all together they shouted out, \"Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us.\"\n(Now Barabbas had been imprisoned for a rebellion that had taken place in the city and for murder.)\nAgain Pilate addressed them, still wishing to release Jesus,\nbut they continued their shouting, \"Crucify him! Crucify him!\"\nPilate addressed them a third time, \"What evil has this man done? I found him guilty of no capital crime. Therefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.\"\nWith loud shouts, however, they persisted in calling for his crucifixion, and their voices prevailed.\nThe verdict of Pilate was that their demand should be granted.\nSo he released the man who had been imprisoned for rebellion and murder, for whom they asked, and he handed Jesus over to them to deal with as they wished.\nAs they led him away they took hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming in from the country; and after laying the cross on him, they made him carry it behind Jesus.\nA large crowd of people followed Jesus, including many women who mourned and lamented him.\nJesus turned to them and said, \"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep instead for yourselves and for your children,\nfor indeed, the days are coming when people will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed.'\nAt that time people will say to the mountains, 'Fall upon us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us!'\nfor if these things are done when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry?\"\nNow two others, both criminals, were led away with him to be executed.\nWhen they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him and the criminals there, one on his right, the other on his left.\n(Then Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.\") They divided his garments by casting lots.\nThe people stood by and watched; the rulers, meanwhile, sneered at him and said, \"He saved others, let him save himself if he is the chosen one, the Messiah of God.\"\nEven the soldiers jeered at him. As they approached to offer him wine\nthey called out, \"If you are King of the Jews, save yourself.\"\nAbove him there was an inscription that read, \"This is the King of the Jews.\"\nNow one of the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying, \"Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us.\"\nThe other, however, rebuking him, said in reply, \"Have you no fear of God, for you are subject to the same condemnation?\nAnd indeed, we have been condemned justly, for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes, but this man has done nothing criminal.\"\nThen he said, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\"\nHe replied to him, \"Amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.\"\nIt was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon\nbecause of an eclipse of the sun. Then the veil of the temple was torn down the middle.\nJesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Father, into your hands I commend my spirit\"; and when he had said this he breathed his last.\nThe centurion who witnessed what had happened glorified God and said, \"This man was innocent beyond doubt.\"\nWhen all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw what had happened, they returned home beating their breasts;\nbut all his acquaintances stood at a distance, including the women who had followed him from Galilee and saw these events.\nNow there was a virtuous and righteous man named Joseph who, though he was a member of the council,\nhad not consented to their plan of action. He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea and was awaiting the kingdom of God.\nHe went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.\nAfter he had taken the body down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid him in a rock-hewn tomb in which no one had yet been buried.\nIt was the day of preparation, and the sabbath was about to begin.\nThe women who had come from Galilee with him followed behind, and when they had seen the tomb and the way in which his body was laid in it,\nthey returned and prepared spices and perfumed oils. Then they rested on the sabbath according to the commandment."

So if you are looking for me, let these men go.\"\nThis was to fulfill what he had said, \"I have not lost any of those you gave me.\"\nThen Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave's name was Malchus.\nJesus said to Peter, \"Put your sword into its scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup that the Father gave me?\"\nSo the band of soldiers, the tribune, and the Jewish guards seized Jesus, bound him,\nand brought him to Annas first. He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.\nIt was Caiaphas who had counseled the Jews that it was better that one man should die rather than the people.\nSimon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Now the other disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered the courtyard of the high priest with Jesus.\nBut Peter stood at the gate outside. So the other disciple, the acquaintance of the high priest, went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter in.\nThen the maid who was the gatekeeper said to Peter, \"You are not one of this man's disciples, are you?\" He said, \"I am not.\"\nNow the slaves and the guards were standing around a charcoal fire that they had made, because it was cold, and were warming themselves. Peter was also standing there keeping warm.\nThe high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his doctrine.\nJesus answered him, \"I have spoken publicly to the world. I have always taught in a synagogue or in the temple area where all the Jews gather, and in secret I have said nothing.\nWhy ask me? Ask those who heard me what I said to them. They know what I said.\"\nWhen he had said this, one of the temple guards standing there struck Jesus and said, \"Is this the way you answer the high priest?\"\nJesus answered him, \"If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?\"\nThen Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.\nNow Simon Peter was standing there keeping warm. And they said to him, \"You are not one of his disciples, are you?\" He denied it and said, \"I am not.\"\nOne of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said, \"Didn't I see you in the garden with him?\"\nAgain Peter denied it. And immediately the cock crowed.\nThen they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium. It was morning. And they themselves did not enter the praetorium, in order not to be defiled so that they could eat the Passover.\nSo Pilate came out to them and said, \"What charge do you bring (against) this man?\"\nThey answered and said to him, \"If he were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.\"\nAt this, Pilate said to them, \"Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.\" The Jews answered him, \"We do not have the right to execute anyone,\"\nin order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled that he said indicating the kind of death he would die.\nSo Pilate went back into the praetorium and summoned Jesus and said to him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\"\nJesus answered, \"Do you say this on your own or have others told you about me?\"\nPilate answered, \"I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?\"\nJesus answered, \"My kingdom does not belong to this world. If my kingdom did belong to this world, my attendants (would) be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not here.\"\nSo Pilate said to him, \"Then you are a king?\" Jesus answered, \"You say I am a king. For this I was born and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.\"\nPilate said to him, \"What is truth?\" When he had said this, he again went out to the Jews and said to them, \"I find no guilt in him.\nBut you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover. Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?\"\nThey cried out again, \"Not this one but Barabbas!\" Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.\nThen Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged.\nAnd the soldiers wove a crown out of thorns and placed it on his head, and clothed him in a purple cloak,\nand they came to him and said, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" And they struck him repeatedly.\nOnce more Pilate went out and said to them, \"Look, I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find no guilt in him.\"\nSo Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak. And he said to them, \"Behold, the man!\"\nWhen the chief priests and the guards saw him they cried out, \"Crucify him, crucify him!\" Pilate said to them, \"Take him yourselves and crucify him. I find no guilt in him.\"\nThe Jews answered, \"We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.\"\nNow when Pilate heard this statement, he became even more afraid,\nand went back into the praetorium and said to Jesus, \"Where are you from?\" Jesus did not answer him.\nSo Pilate said to him, \"Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you and I have power to crucify you?\"\nJesus answered (him), \"You would have no power over me if it had not been given to you from above. For this reason the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin.\"\nConsequently, Pilate tried to release him; but the Jews cried out, \"If you release him, you are not a Friend of Caesar. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.\"\nWhen Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus out and seated him on the judge's bench in the place called Stone Pavement, in Hebrew, Gabbatha.\nIt was preparation day for Passover, and it was about noon. And he said to the Jews, \"Behold, your king!\"\nThey cried out, \"Take him away, take him away! Crucify him!\" Pilate said to them, \"Shall I crucify your king?\" The chief priests answered, \"We have no king but Caesar.\"\nThen he handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus,\nand carrying the cross himself he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull, in Hebrew, Golgotha.\nThere they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus in the middle.\nPilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It read, \"Jesus the Nazorean, the King of the Jews.\"\nNow many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.\nSo the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, \"Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that he said, 'I am the King of the Jews.'\"\nPilate answered, \"What I have written, I have written.\"\nWhen the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares, a share for each soldier. They also took his tunic, but the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top down.\nSo they said to one another, \"Let's not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be,\" in order that the passage of scripture might be fulfilled (that says): \"They divided my garments among them, and for my vesture they cast lots.\" This is what the soldiers did.\nStanding by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala.\nWhen Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved, he said to his mother, \"Woman, behold, your son.\"\nThen he said to the disciple, \"Behold, your mother.\" And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.\nAfter this, aware that everything was now finished, in order that the scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, \"I thirst.\"\nThere was a vessel filled with common wine. So they put a sponge soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop and put it up to his mouth.\nWhen Jesus had taken the wine, he said, \"It is finished.\" And bowing his head, he handed over the spirit.\nNow since it was preparation day, in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for the sabbath day of that week was a solemn one, the Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken and they be taken down.\nSo the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus.\nBut when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs,\nbut one soldier thrust his lance into his side, and immediately blood and water flowed out.\nAn eyewitness has testified, and his testimony is true; he knows that he is speaking the truth, so that you also may (come to) believe.\nFor this happened so that the scripture passage might be fulfilled: \"Not a bone of it will be broken.\"\nAnd again another passage says: \"They will look upon him whom they have pierced.\"\nAfter this, Joseph of Arimathea, secretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus. And Pilate permitted it. So he came and took his body.\nNicodemus, the one who had first come to him at night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about one hundred pounds.\nThey took the body of Jesus and bound it with burial cloths along with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom.\nNow in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried.\nSo they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day; for the tomb was close by."

Then I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots and charioteers.\nThe Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I receive glory through Pharaoh and his chariots and charioteers.\"\nThe angel of God, who had been leading Israel's camp, now moved and went around behind them. The column of cloud also, leaving the front, took up its place behind them,\nso that it came between the camp of the Egyptians and that of Israel. But the cloud now became dark, and thus the night passed without the rival camps coming any closer together all night long.\nThen Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD swept the sea with a strong east wind throughout the night and so turned it into dry land. When the water was thus divided,\nthe Israelites marched into the midst of the sea on dry land, with the water like a wall to their right and to their left.\nThe Egyptians followed in pursuit; all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and charioteers went after them right into the midst of the sea.\nIn the night watch just before dawn the LORD cast through the column of the fiery cloud upon the Egyptian force a glance that threw it into a panic;\nand he so clogged their chariot wheels that they could hardly drive. With that the Egyptians sounded the retreat before Israel, because the LORD was fighting for them against the Egyptians.\nThen the LORD told Moses, \"Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may flow back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and their charioteers.\"\nSo Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at dawn the sea flowed back to its normal depth. The Egyptians were fleeing head on toward the sea, when the LORD hurled them into its midst.\nAs the water flowed back, it covered the chariots and the charioteers of Pharaoh's whole army which had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not a single one of them escaped.\nBut the Israelites had marched on dry land through the midst of the sea, with the water like a wall to their right and to their left.\nThus the LORD saved Israel on that day from the power of the Egyptians. When Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the seashore\nand beheld the great power that the LORD had shown against the Egyptians, they feared the LORD and believed in him and in his servant Moses.\nThen Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD: I will sing to the LORD, for he is gloriously triumphant; horse and chariot he has cast into the sea."

When they came to the land of Canaan,\nAbram passed through the land as far as the sacred place at Shechem, by the terebinth of Moreh. (The Canaanites were then in the land.)\nThe LORD appeared to Abram and said, \"To your descendants I will give this land.\" So Abram built an altar there to the LORD who had appeared to him.\nFrom there he moved on to the hill country east of Bethel, pitching his tent with Bethel to the west and Ai to the east. He built an altar there to the LORD and invoked the LORD by name.\nThen Abram journeyed on by stages to the Negeb."

                "reading": "Jacob departed from Beer-sheba and proceeded toward Haran.\nWhen he came upon a certain shrine, as the sun had already set, he stopped there for the night. Taking one of the stones at the shrine, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep at that spot.\nThen he had a dream: a stairway rested on the ground, with its top reaching to the heavens; and God's messengers were going up and down on it.\nAnd there was the LORD standing beside him and saying: \"I, the LORD, am the God of your forefather Abraham and the God of Isaac; the land on which you are lying I will give to you and your descendants.\nThese shall be as plentiful as the dust of the earth, and through them you shall spread out east and west, north and south. In you and your descendants all the nations of the earth shall find blessing.\nKnow that I am with you; I will protect you wherever you go, and bring you back to this land. I will never leave you until I have done what I promised you.\"\nWhen Jacob awoke from his sleep, he exclaimed, \"Truly, the LORD is in this spot, although I did not know it!\"\nIn solemn wonder he cried out: \"How awesome is this shrine! This is nothing else but an abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven!\"\nEarly the next morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head, set it up as a memorial stone, and poured oil on top of it.\nHe called that site Bethel, whereas the former name of the town had been Luz.\nJacob then made this vow: \"If God remains with me, to protect me on this journey I am making and to give me enough bread to eat and clothing to wear,\nand I come back safe to my father's house, the LORD shall be my God.\nThis stone that I have set up as a memorial stone shall be God's abode.\""

But come, lay your hand on her, and she will live.\"\nJesus rose and followed him, and so did his disciples.\nA woman suffering hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the tassel on his cloak.\nShe said to herself, \"If only I can touch his cloak, I shall be cured.\"\nJesus turned around and saw her, and said, \"Courage, daughter! Your faith has saved you.\" And from that hour the woman was cured.\nWhen Jesus arrived at the official's house and saw the flute players and the crowd who were making a commotion,\nhe said, \"Go away! The girl is not dead but sleeping.\" And they ridiculed him.\nWhen the crowd was put out, he came and took her by the hand, and the little girl arose.\nAnd news of this spread throughout all that land."
