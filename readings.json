Now Nineveh was an enormously large city; it took three days to go through it.\nJonah began his journey through the city, and had gone but a single day's walk announcing, \"Forty days more and Nineveh shall be destroyed,\"\nwhen the people of Nineveh believed God; they proclaimed a fast and all of them, great and small, put on sackcloth.\nWhen the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, laid aside his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in the ashes.\nThen he had this proclaimed throughout Nineveh, by decree of the king and his nobles: \"Neither man nor beast, neither cattle nor sheep, shall taste anything; they shall not eat, nor shall they drink water.\nMan and beast shall be covered with sackcloth and call loudly to God; every man shall turn from his evil way and from the violence he has in hand.\nWho knows, God may relent and forgive, and withhold his blazing wrath, so that we shall not perish.\"\nWhen God saw by their actions how they turned from their evil way, he repented of the evil that he had threatened to do to them; he did not carry it out."
