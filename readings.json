Again he measured off a thousand and had me wade; the water was up to my waist.\nOnce more he measured off a thousand, but there was now a river through which I could not wade; for the water had risen so high it had become a river that could not be crossed except by swimming.\nHe asked me, \"Have you seen this, son of man?\" Then he brought me to the bank of the river, where he had me sit.\nAlong the bank of the river I saw very many trees on both sides.\nHe said to me, \"This water flows into the eastern district down upon the Arabah, and empties into the sea, the salt waters, which it makes fresh.\nWherever the river flows, every sort of living creature that can multiply shall live, and there shall be abundant fish, for wherever this water comes the sea shall be made fresh.\nAlong both banks of the river, fruit trees of every kind shall grow; their leaves shall not fade, nor their fruit fail.

Before all the people they ordered:\n\"Send for Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah, the wife of Joakim.\" When she was sent for,\nshe came with her parents, children and all her relatives.\nAll her relatives and the onlookers were weeping.\nIn the midst of the people the two elders rose up and laid their hands on her head.\nThrough her tears she looked up to heaven, for she trusted in the Lord wholeheartedly.\nThe elders made this accusation: \"As we were walking in the garden alone, this woman entered with two girls and shut the doors of the garden, dismissing the girls.\nA young man, who was hidden there, came and lay with her.\nWhen we, in a corner of the garden, saw this crime, we ran toward them.\nWe saw them lying together, but the man we could not hold, because he was stronger than we; he opened the doors and ran off.\nThen we seized this one and asked who the young man was,\nbut she refused to tell us. We testify to this.\" The assembly believed them, since they were elders and judges of the people, and they condemned her to death.\nBut Susanna cried aloud: \"O eternal God, you know what is hidden and are aware of all things before they come to be:\nyou know that they have testified falsely against me. Here I am about to die, though I have done none of the things with which these wicked men have charged me.\"\nThe Lord heard her prayer.\nAs she was being led to execution, God stirred up the holy spirit of a young boy named Daniel,\nand he cried aloud: \"I will have no part in the death of this woman.\"\nAll the people turned and asked him, \"What is this you are saying?\"\nHe stood in their midst and continued, \"Are you such fools, O Israelites! To condemn a woman of Israel without examination and without clear evidence?\nReturn to court, for they have testified falsely against her.\"\nThen all the people returned in haste. To Daniel the elders said, \"Come, sit with us and inform us, since God has given you the prestige of old age.\"\nBut he replied, \"Separate these two far from one another that I may examine them.\"\nAfter they were separated one from the other, he called one of them and said: \"How you have grown evil with age! Now have your past sins come to term:\npassing unjust sentences, condemning the innocent, and freeing the guilty, although the Lord says, \"The innocent and the just you shall not put to death.'\nNow, then, if you were a witness, tell me under what tree you saw them together.\"\n\"Under a mastic tree,\" he answered. \"Your fine lie has cost you your head,\" said Daniel; \"for the angel of God shall receive the sentence from him and split you in two.\"\nPutting him to one side, he ordered the other one to be brought. \"Offspring of Canaan, not of Judah,\" Daniel said to him, \"beauty has seduced you, lust has subverted your conscience.\nThis is how you acted with the daughters of Israel, and in their fear they yielded to you; but a daughter of Judah did not tolerate your wickedness.\nNow, then, tell me under what tree you surprised them together.\"\n\"Under an oak,\" he said. \"Your fine lie has cost you also your head,\" said Daniel; \"for the angel of God waits with a sword to cut you in two so as to make an end of you both.\"\nThe whole assembly cried aloud, blessing God who saves those that hope in him.\nThey rose up against the two elders, for by their own words Daniel had convicted them of perjury. According to the law of Moses, they inflicted on them the penalty they had plotted to impose on their neighbor:\nthey put them to death. Thus was innocent blood spared that day."

Rather, let the greatest among you be as the youngest, and the leader as the servant.\nFor who is greater: the one seated at table or the one who serves? Is it not the one seated at table? I am among you as the one who serves.\nIt is you who have stood by me in my trials;\nand I confer a kingdom on you, just as my Father has conferred one on me,\nthat you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\nSimon, Simon, behold Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat,\nbut I have prayed that your own faith may not fail; and once you have turned back, you must strengthen your brothers.\"\nHe said to him, \"Lord, I am prepared to go to prison and to die with you.\"\nBut he replied, \"I tell you, Peter, before the cock crows this day, you will deny three times that you know me.\"\nHe said to them, \"When I sent you forth without a money bag or a sack or sandals, were you in need of anything?\" \"No, nothing,\" they replied.\nHe said to them, \"But now one who has a money bag should take it, and likewise a sack, and one who does not have a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.\nFor I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, namely, 'He was counted among the wicked'; and indeed what is written about me is coming to fulfillment.\"\nThen they said, \"Lord, look, there are two swords here.\" But he replied, \"It is enough!\"\nThen going out he went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.\nWhen he arrived at the place he said to them, \"Pray that you may not undergo the test.\"\nAfter withdrawing about a stone's throw from them and kneeling, he prayed,\nsaying, \"Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me; still, not my will but yours be done.\"\n(And to strengthen him an angel from heaven appeared to him.\nHe was in such agony and he prayed so fervently that his sweat became like drops of blood falling on the ground.)\nWhen he rose from prayer and returned to his disciples, he found them sleeping from grief.\nHe said to them, \"Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not undergo the test.\"\nWhile he was still speaking, a crowd approached and in front was one of the Twelve, a man named Judas. He went up to Jesus to kiss him.\nJesus said to him, \"Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?\"\nHis disciples realized what was about to happen, and they asked, \"Lord, shall we strike with a sword?\"\nAnd one of them struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear.\nBut Jesus said in reply, \"Stop, no more of this!\" Then he touched the servant's ear and healed him.\nAnd Jesus said to the chief priests and temple guards and elders who had come for him, \"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?\nDay after day I was with you in the temple area, and you did not seize me; but this is your hour, the time for the power of darkness.\"\nAfter arresting him they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest; Peter was following at a distance.\nThey lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it, and Peter sat down with them.\nWhen a maid saw him seated in the light, she looked intently at him and said, \"This man too was with him.\"\nBut he denied it saying, \"Woman, I do not know him.\"\nA short while later someone else saw him and said, \"You too are one of them\"; but Peter answered, \"My friend, I am not.\"\nAbout an hour later, still another insisted, \"Assuredly, this man too was with him, for he also is a Galilean.\"\nBut Peter said, \"My friend, I do not know what you are talking about.\" Just as he was saying this, the cock crowed,\nand the Lord turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, \"Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.\"\nHe went out and began to weep bitterly.\nThe men who held Jesus in custody were ridiculing and beating him.\nThey blindfolded him and questioned him, saying, \"Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?\"\nAnd they reviled him in saying many other things against him.\nWhen day came the council of elders of the people met, both chief priests and scribes, and they brought him before their Sanhedrin.\nThey said, \"If you are the Messiah, tell us,\" but he replied to them, \"If I tell you, you will not believe,\nand if I question, you will not respond.\nBut from this time on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\"\nThey all asked, \"Are you then the Son of God?\" He replied to them, \"You say that I am.\"\nThen they said, \"What further need have we for testimony? We have heard it from his own mouth.\"\nThen the whole assembly of them arose and brought him before Pilate.\nThey brought charges against him, saying, \"We found this man misleading our people; he opposes the payment of taxes to Caesar and maintains that he is the Messiah, a king.\"\nPilate asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" He said to him in reply, \"You say so.\"\nPilate then addressed the chief priests and the crowds, \"I find this man not guilty.\"\nBut they were adamant and said, \"He is inciting the people with his teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee where he began even to here.\"\nOn hearing this Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean;\nand upon learning that he was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod who was in Jerusalem at that time.\nHerod was very glad to see Jesus; he had been wanting to see him for a long time, for he had heard about him and had been hoping to see him perform some sign.\nHe questioned him at length, but he gave him no answer.\nThe chief priests and scribes, meanwhile, stood by accusing him harshly.\n(Even) Herod and his soldiers treated him contemptuously and mocked him, and after clothing him in resplendent garb, he sent him back to Pilate.\nHerod and Pilate became friends that very day, even though they had been enemies formerly.\nPilate then summoned the chief priests, the rulers, and the people\nand said to them, \"You brought this man to me and accused him of inciting the people to revolt. I have conducted my investigation in your presence and have not found this man guilty of the charges you have brought against him,\nnor did Herod, for he sent him back to us. So no capital crime has been committed by him.\nTherefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.\"\n\nBut all together they shouted out, \"Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us.\"\n(Now Barabbas had been imprisoned for a rebellion that had taken place in the city and for murder.)\nAgain Pilate addressed them, still wishing to release Jesus,\nbut they continued their shouting, \"Crucify him! Crucify him!\"\nPilate addressed them a third time, \"What evil has this man done? I found him guilty of no capital crime. Therefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.\"\nWith loud shouts, however, they persisted in calling for his crucifixion, and their voices prevailed.\nThe verdict of Pilate was that their demand should be granted.\nSo he released the man who had been imprisoned for rebellion and murder, for whom they asked, and he handed Jesus over to them to deal with as they wished.\nAs they led him away they took hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming in from the country; and after laying the cross on him, they made him carry it behind Jesus.\nA large crowd of people followed Jesus, including many women who mourned and lamented him.\nJesus turned to them and said, \"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep instead for yourselves and for your children,\nfor indeed, the days are coming when people will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed.'\nAt that time people will say to the mountains, 'Fall upon us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us!'\nfor if these things are done when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry?\"\nNow two others, both criminals, were led away with him to be executed.\nWhen they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him and the criminals there, one on his right, the other on his left.\n(Then Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.\") They divided his garments by casting lots.\nThe people stood by and watched; the rulers, meanwhile, sneered at him and said, \"He saved others, let him save himself if he is the chosen one, the Messiah of God.\"\nEven the soldiers jeered at him. As they approached to offer him wine\nthey called out, \"If you are King of the Jews, save yourself.\"\nAbove him there was an inscription that read, \"This is the King of the Jews.\"\nNow one of the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying, \"Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us.\"\nThe other, however, rebuking him, said in reply, \"Have you no fear of God, for you are subject to the same condemnation?\nAnd indeed, we have been condemned justly, for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes, but this man has done nothing criminal.\"\nThen he said, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\"\nHe replied to him, \"Amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.\"\nIt was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon\nbecause of an eclipse of the sun. Then the veil of the temple was torn down the middle.\nJesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Father, into your hands I commend my spirit\"; and when he had said this he breathed his last.\nThe centurion who witnessed what had happened glorified God and said, \"This man was innocent beyond doubt.\"\nWhen all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw what had happened, they returned home beating their breasts;\nbut all his acquaintances stood at a distance, including the women who had followed him from Galilee and saw these events.\nNow there was a virtuous and righteous man named Joseph who, though he was a member of the council,\nhad not consented to their plan of action. He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea and was awaiting the kingdom of God.\nHe went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.\nAfter he had taken the body down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid him in a rock-hewn tomb in which no one had yet been buried.\nIt was the day of preparation, and the sabbath was about to begin.\nThe women who had come from Galilee with him followed behind, and when they had seen the tomb and the way in which his body was laid in it,\nthey returned and prepared spices and perfumed oils. Then they rested on the sabbath according to the commandment."

Do this in remembrance of me.\"\nIn the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.\"\nFor as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord until he comes."

                "reading": "Before the feast of Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come  to pass from this world to the Father.  He loved his own in the world and he loved them to the end.\nThe devil had already induced Judas, son of Simon the Iscariot, to hand him over. So, during supper,\nfully aware that the Father had put everything into his power and that he had come from God and was returning to God,\nhe rose from supper and took off his outer garments. He took a towel and tied it around his waist.\nThen he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and dry them with the towel around his waist.\nHe came to Simon Peter, who said to him, \"Master, are you going to wash my feet?\"\nJesus answered and said to him, \"What I am doing, you do not understand now, but you will understand later.\"\nPeter said to him, \"You will never wash my feet.\" Jesus answered him, \"Unless I wash you, you will have no inheritance with me.\"\nSimon Peter said to him, \"Master, then not only my feet, but my hands and head as well.\"\nJesus said to him, \"Whoever has bathed has no need except to have his feet washed, for he is clean all over; so you are clean, but not all.\"\nFor he knew who would betray him; for this reason, he said, \"Not all of you are clean.\"\nSo when he had washed their feet (and) put his garments back on and reclined at table again, he said to them, \"Do you realize what I have done for you?\nYou call me 'teacher' and 'master,' and rightly so, for indeed I am.\nIf I, therefore, the master and teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash one another's feet.\nI have given you a model to follow, so that as I have done for you, you should also do."
