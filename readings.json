Return to the LORD and give up sin, pray to him and make your offenses few.\nTurn again to the Most High and away from sin, hate intensely what he loathes; and know the justice and judgments of God, stand firm in the way set before you, in prayer to the Most High God.\nWho in the nether world can glorify the Most High in place of the living who offer their praise? Dwell no longer in the error of the ungodly, but offer your praise before death.\nNo more can the dead give praise than those who have never lived; they glorify the LORD who are alive and well.\nHow great the mercy of the LORD, his forgiveness of those who return to him!"

No one is good but God alone.\nYou know the commandments: 'You shall not kill; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness; you shall not defraud; honor your father and your mother.'\"\nHe replied and said to him, \"Teacher, all of these I have observed from my youth.\"\nJesus, looking at him, loved him and said to him, \"You are lacking in one thing. Go, sell what you have, and give to (the) poor and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.\"\nAt that statement his face fell, and he went away sad, for he had many possessions.\nJesus looked around and said to his disciples, \"How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!\"\nThe disciples were amazed at his words. So Jesus again said to them in reply, \"Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!\nIt is easier for a camel to pass through (the) eye of (a) needle than for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\"\nThey were exceedingly astonished and said among themselves, \"Then who can be saved?\"\nJesus looked at them and said, \"For human beings it is impossible, but not for God. All things are possible for God.\""

Trust not in sacrifice of the fruits of extortion,\nFor he is a God of justice, who knows no favorites."
